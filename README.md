# Poor mans DWM1001

Or the rich one's it depends on the perspective.

I happened to buy a few DWM1000s from the mouser and then when they arrived I have realized that the Decawave released the DWM1001 modules with a supported software stack, etc. So I deciced to create a board which hosts a E73-2G4M04S BLE module and provides connection to my DWM1000 breakout boards. The HW provides the same connections what the DWM1001 has just in bigger size.
