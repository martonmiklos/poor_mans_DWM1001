# Poor man's DWM1001

(Or the rich one's it depends on the perspective.)

I happened to buy a few DWM1000s from the mouser. When they arrived I have realized that the Decawave have just released the DWM1001 modules with a supported software stack, etc. So I deciced to create a board which hosts a E73-2G4M04S BLE module and provides connection to my DWM1000 breakout boards. The HW provides the same connections what the DWM1001 has just in bigger size.
